# Description

Hi! This small project is intended to learn about Schedule library, and how to create a small pipeline in Python.
In short, the pipeline.py executes its code every 5 minutes with a scheduler asocciated with the function job, creating a new csv; this function job automates tasks such as:

1. Extraing data
2. Transforming or cleaning data
3. Load or export data in a csv (every 5 minutes)

If you want to use this small script
1. Clone the code
2. Run from the terminal and execute: python pipeline.py
3. Let the terminal executing in a second plane

Thanks a lot for your attention c:
You can use this repo as a guide if you want to!
