Hi! ğŸ‘‹ This small project is intended to learn how to create a simple data pipeline in Python using the `schedule` library.

### ğŸ§  What it does:

Every 5 minutes, `pipeline.py` executes a job that:
- ğŸ“¥ Extracts data from an external API, NewsAPI
- ğŸ§¹ Transforms and cleans the data using pandas
- ğŸ’¾ Loads/exports the data into a `.csv` file

### ğŸš€ How to use it:

1. Clone this repo
2. Run from the terminal:
   ```bash
   python pipeline.py

You can use this repo as a guide if you want to learn in a easier way about automatization c:
Feel free to use it!
